# 🚗 Autonomous Driving Project 🚗

## 🎯 **Project Goals**
> The project's goal is to delve into critical technologies underpinning self-driving systems with Computer Vision algorithms. I aim to craft a hands-on ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems) & DMS (Driver Monitoring System) through these algorithms. Additionally, this project offers an opportunity to grasp the overarching architecture of autonomous driving systems by intertwining various tasks for a holistic view of the technologies.


## 📌 Tasks:

### 📸 1. Perception
- **Segmentation**: Implementing image segmentation to differentiate between objects and roadways.
- **DMS System**: Constructing a Driver Monitoring System to ensure the driver's alertness and safety.
- **ADAS Camera System**: Designing a vision-based system for advanced driver assistance.

### 🌐 2. LiDAR Perception
- **3D Object Detection**: Utilizing point cloud data to detect and classify objects in 3D.
- **3D Segmentation**: Developing models to segment the 3D environment for enhanced scene understanding.

### 🤝 3. Sensor Fusion
- **Point-level Fusion**: Merging data from multiple sensors at the raw data level.
- **Feature-level Fusion**: Combining features extracted from various sensors to create a cohesive representation of the environment.

### 🗺️ 4. SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping)
- **Image Processing**: Harnessing images to extract essential information for the SLAM process.
- **Point Cloud Processing**: Manipulating LiDAR data to pull out useful features for mapping.
- **Visual SLAM**: Employing images to simultaneously chart the environment and pinpoint the vehicle's location within it.
- **LiDAR SLAM**: Using LiDAR data for dual tasks of mapping and localization. This is designed in both Python and C++.

### 🛣️ 5. Path Planning & Control
- **Lane Change**: Envisioning a mechanism for safe and efficient lane transitions on highways.
- **Intersection Handling**: Strategizing for seamless entry and exit maneuvers at rotations and intersections.
