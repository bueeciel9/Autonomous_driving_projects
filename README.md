# 🚗 Autonomous Driving Project 🚗

## 🎯 **Project Goals**
> The project's goal is to delve into critical technologies underpinning self-driving systems with Computer Vision algorithms. We aim to craft a hands-on ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems) & DMS (Driver Monitoring System) through these algorithms. Additionally, this project offers an opportunity to grasp the overarching architecture of autonomous driving systems by intertwining various tasks for a holistic view of the technologies.


## 📌 Tasks:
